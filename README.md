# Frontend Mentor: #2 Sunnyside Agency Landing Page

```
Name : Sunnyside agency landing page
Description : This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills.
              There's a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu, but the focus is HTML & CSS.
Difficulty : 2-JUNIOR
Status: Complete
Challenge : https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef
```

okay, so frontend mentor wants me to post a readme in a particular format, being the rebel I am, I'd gladly not comply to that request.
I really want to only focus on coding these things out as fast as I humanly can and not deal into documentation related specifics.

As my [bootstrap repo](https://github.com/namanavasthi/frontend-mentor-bootstrap) already mentions any tech stack related information necessary.

## Thoughts

- as i'm building this thing up, i'd probably focus more on the mobile comps first and then move over to desktop. I just prefer it that way.
- once im done with base level layout-ing of components and how those components would be arranged, i'd move onto any tailwind related changes needed
- after that comes interactions (click)
  > NOTE : if not explicitly mentioned, I WOULD NOT worry about accessibility.
- since im using tailwind defaults, i'd try to bring it as close as i can to the original without actually measuring things around
  > NOTE : look! this isnt TS, i want to get done with these REAL quick, don't have the time to satisfy tailwind's absurd ts needs
- fonts are a pain in the but, and I don't really like the fact I'm loading in 3 font weight variants, so instead I'm gonna load only one font (thin) and apply bold style to it, yes it won't show up, but hey, care was taken (at least some)
- semantic html isn't my forte, please ignore mistakes there
- tailwind is annoying with focus + responsive border styles, tried to add those in navbar styles, but was taking too long. skipping it for now.
- didn't pay much attention to pixel perfect desktop, got busy at work :/
- üêº if i get time (or motivation), i'd make them images load dynamically

## Structure

- header
- nav
